# Reproducing the experiments of the paper

To reproduce the experiments of the paper, first build the software as
detailed in the main README file. Then, run the `run.sh` script, which
will run all the experiments and produce the tables and plots.  The
software has been tested on a Linux box running Ubuntu 16.04 on a
Intel I7 processor with 18GB of RAMT.

There will be small differences between the plots generated
and the figures of the paper, due to the random nature of the
algorithms and possibly different hardware configurations.
